# Debugging
## Outcome

You'll:

* Be able to debug your code

## Prerequisites

* Javascript ES5.

## Advice

Debugging is a useful technique for figuring out what's wrong when your code doesn't work. It also doubles as an amazing learning tool. You can use the debugger to see all the variables of your program and step through line by line.

## Learning materials

### Core
* [Codeschool course](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/1?locale=en) (1-4 only)

## Tasks

* Watch the codeschool
* Go back to javascript tasks and set some break points, step through line by line, watch the variables change. Type some things in the console (use some of your variables) whilst the program is paused.
