# Terminology

# Operator

Special built-in keywords you can use in the middle of an expression which do things.

Examples:

```
#Add
1 + 1
=> 2

#Subtract
1 - 1
=> 0

#Divide
9 / 3 
=> 3

#Multiply (times)
3 * 3 
=> 9

#Mod (Modulus)
Tells you the remainder of a division

9 % 3
=> 0

9 % 2
=> 1 (because it goes in 4 times remainder 1)

#And
true && false
=> false
false && true
=> false
false && false
=> false
true && true
=> true

#Or
true || false
=> true

false || false
=> false

```

# Evaluate (sometimes called: Execute, Calculate)

Javascript calculating the value of something. You can practice this in the console.

The simplest example is the mathematical operators.

e.g. 

```
1 + 1 
=> 2
```
Javascript has evaluated (or calculated) the result.

There is a particular order it does this which we covered earlier.

# Expression
Something Javascript can evaluate.

Expressions can contain sub expressions. There is an order Javascript will execute the expressions in.

e.g. 
`1` <- a very simple expression
`1 + 1` <- an expression which contains other expressions within it.
`"hello".substring(0, 3).length`
  ^3      ^4       ^1 ^2 ^5    <-- execution order

# Declaration (sometimes called: definition or defining)

`const x = "x"` is a declaration. We say you're "Declaring x".

Other examples:

```
var x = 1
const myArray = []
const myObject = {hello: "world"}
```
