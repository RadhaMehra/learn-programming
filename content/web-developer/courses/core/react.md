# React
## Outcome

You'll:

* Understand what react is and be able to make interactive web apps with it.

## Advice

We don't use much state in our applications. (We use a library called Redux instead in a lot of cases).

Don't use bind like he does. You can use a lambda instead.

`<MyComponent myProp={this.myFunc} />` won't work because `this` will be the wrong `this` (crapness of JS). But this works: 
`<MyComponent myProp={() => this.myFunc()} />`
