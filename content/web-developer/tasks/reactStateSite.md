# React State Site

You will be building a site using React and State. 

* Site should have a number of interactive parts (at lest 3)
* Quite simple (state can be a bit tricky so best to save those great ideas for redux)
* Styling can be very poor

1. 

Draw, sketch, make in a word or screenshot a website you want to make.

Draw boxes around parts you think will be components.

Share this with us.

If you can't think of anything John has a basic idea that you can use but doing your own stuff is always more intresting!

2.

[Setup your project in a fresh repo](./cloneReactSeedInstructions.md)

Go build it. 

Setup a build on circleci for your project: https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/getting-started/ (The build should pass before you send us a PR)

And submit PRs which are less than 6 screens of diff high so we can review your work / progress.
