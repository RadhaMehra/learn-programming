Create a github repo and commit your answers regularly inside the repo.

Use [this repo]( https://github.com/z-dev/simple-js-site/tree/master) as a template of how to structure your github.

Which concateonates the names together with a space between.

### 3

Write a function `lastNameFirstName(firstName, lastName)`

Which concateonates the names together like this: `'Gill, Richard'` (with a comma)

### 4

`var firstName = 'Richard'`

print the length of the var (7).

### 5

`var people = ['Jack', 'John', 'James']`

Using `people` print out all these names to the console.

```
Jack
John
James
```

Note: Your answer should work for a `var people` of any length. E.g. `var people = ['Jack']` or `var people = ['Jack', 'John']`
