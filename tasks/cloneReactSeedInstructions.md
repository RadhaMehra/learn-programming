Start with this codebase: https://github.com/z-dev/react-seed

```
// Clone it locally.
cd into it
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m ‘Initial commit’
// Create a fresh github repo and grab the ssh / https url on the right hand side
git remote add origin <git repo url>
git push origin master
```
Look at the instructions in readme.md inside the react-seed project to get started
