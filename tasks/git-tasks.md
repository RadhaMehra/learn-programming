Do `git status` at each step to see what is going on.

* Create a public git repo on github.com
* Clone the repo locally (command line)
* Create a readme.md
* Do a commit to master (command line)
* Push that commit on github (command line)
* Create a branch (and switch to it) (command line)
* Do a change to readme.md and commit it to the branch (command line)
* Submit a pull request on that branch on github.com which we will approve

Note take a look at the 'files changed' tab. This tab will show you the files which have changed with a nice diff.
