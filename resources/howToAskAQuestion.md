# How to ask a question

Do you have **NO** idea what you're doing / what you're supposed to be doing. And you don't even know what your problem is?

Ok just say so.

If you have a problem you want help with please ask a question with:

* What you think the problem is.
* Give us as much code as possible (multiple files, or a link to a github repo where you've verified the problem exists)
* What you've tried / different ideas you had
* What you googled

Basically make your question as easy to answer as possible.

You should be spending >= 5 mins putting a question together.

It's ok to be wrong / look silly if you ask a good question.

## Examples

### Good question

Hi guys, I was doing the redux tasks and I keep getting this error: `ERROR GOES HERE`.

Here is my reducer.js:
```
code code code
```

My action.js
```
code code code
```

And the component where I am calling the action:
```
code code code
```

I think the problem is that my reducer code is blowing up but I'm not sure.

I tried changing my component to call the code like this `this.prop.something`....

I googled: "how to tell if your reducer code is blowing up", "<the error> redux" ...etc.
