# How win with Pull Requests

## The Checklist

1. Does the Lint pass? 
2. Review it yourself. Can you spot any problems which will obviously get flagged?
3. Is the PR less than 3 screens high?
4. Are you DRY (Have you repeated yourself anywhere)?
5. Are there any files > 3 screens high?
6. Do all of your names for `const`s and functions make sense for human beings! (Go with nouns a child could understand)
7. Do you have any functions > 7 lines in length (aim for 5 or less)?
8. Are the commits / file changes you see just the one's you were expecting (nobody else's work, no old work)?
9. Are there any conflicts? These should be resolved before sending them across. See our [conflict resolution guide](https://github.com/z-dev/learn-programming/blob/master/resources/git-conflicts.md).
