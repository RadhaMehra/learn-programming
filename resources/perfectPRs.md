# How win with Pull Requests

## The Checklist

* Does the Lint pass? 
* Review it yourself. Can you spot any problems which will obviously get flagged?
* Is the PR less than 3 screens high?
* Are you DRY (Have you repeated yourself anywhere)?
* Are there any files > 3 screens high?
* Do all of your names for `const`s and functions make sense for human beings! (Go with nouns a child could understand)
* Do you have any functions > 7 lines in length (aim for 5 or less)?
* Are the commits / file changes you see just the one's you were expecting (nobody else's work, no old work)?
* Are there any conflicts? These should be resolved before sending them across. See our [conflict resolution guide](https://github.com/z-dev/learn-programming/blob/master/resources/git-conflicts.md).
